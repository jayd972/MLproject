# Predicting Student Performance Using Machine Learning

This project explores the use of machine learning to forecast students' academic performance in mathematics by analyzing factors such as gender, ethnicity, parental education level, lunch type, test preparation courses, and exam scores. The insights generated by this predictive model can help educators identify students who may require additional support and develop strategies to enhance learning outcomes.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is the **Students Performance in Exams** dataset available on Kaggle. It includes details about students' demographics, parental education, lunch types, test preparation courses, and their math scores.

---

## Model Training

The machine learning model employs supervised learning algorithms, such as decision trees or random forests, to predict math scores. The dataset is divided into training and testing subsets to evaluate model accuracy and ensure robustness. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning to optimize performance.

---

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 85% in predicting mathematics performance. Key findings indicate that parental education, test preparation courses, and lunch types significantly affect math scores. These insights underscore the importance of addressing these factors to improve student outcomes.
